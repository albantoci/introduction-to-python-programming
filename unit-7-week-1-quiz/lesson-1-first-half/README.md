# First Half

The function `first_half` returns the "first" half of a string (pretty obvious, right?). So, if you invoke `first_half('abcdef')` you should get `'abc'` as a result. But, what happens if the string has an odd number of characters, example: `first_half('abcXdef')` (7 characters). In that case, `fist_half` should include the character in the middle; the result **should be**: `abcX`.

For this assignment you'll have to check the length of the string and handle the even/odd cases.
