# Welcome to RMOTR!

Hello there! Welcome to our [Introduction to Python Programming](https://rmotr.com/introduction-to-python-programming) course. If you're about to start our course and you feel a little bit lost, don't worry, this is the right place to start. We'll draw a few pointers and provide you with some directions to move around. But before we do that, **remember that you can ALWAYS reach out to us for help**. Let's get started! This document will show you the following topics:

* Requirements before the course
* This platform
* How to join a class
* How to get help

## Requirements before the course

This course is intended for beginners that are just getting started. But even we have thought it to be fore complete beginners, we **STRONGLY RECOMMEND YOU** to take a look at our [Free Python Course](https://learn.rmotr.com/python/free-python-course), which serves as prep work for this course. It shouldn't take you more than 2/3 days to do the entire practice and feel a lot more comfortable at the beginning of this course. Think it in this way: the more you know upfront, the better experience you'll have during the course.
