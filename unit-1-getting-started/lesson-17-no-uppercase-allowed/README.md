# No Uppercase Allowed

Complete the function `neutralize_uppercase` so that it returns `stringy` as it was received if there are no capital letters in it or an empty string "" if there were. You need to use a while loop to go through each letter of the string one at a time to check for uppercase letters.

Hint: You'll probably need to use len() to figure out your condition to stop looping through the string. You'll also need to use upper().

```python
my_string = "howdy"
print(my_string[1]) # Prints "o", the second character of the string
```
