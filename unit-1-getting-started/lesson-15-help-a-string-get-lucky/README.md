# Help a String Get Lucky

Use a while loop to complete the function `get_lucky` so that it receives a string `poor_string` and an integer `lucky_number` as a parameter. Add "7" to `poor_string` an amount of times equal to `lucky_number`.

Hint: You can use the `+=` operator to concatenate new stuff to strings.

Another Hint: You might need to keep track of how many times you've added the string "7" somewhere. And watch out for those infinite loops. They're dangerous!

I was in no way listening to Daft Punk during the creation of this assignment.
