# The Power of While Loops

Use a while loop to complete the function `feel_the_power` so that it takes the `initial_number` and multiplies it by itself `power` number of times.

Hint: You'll need additional variables to keep track of both the result and how many times you've multiplied it by itself. 

Hint 2: Remember, with multiplication, you start your result at 1 instead of 0 because if you multiply by 0 you get 0.

Hint 3: NO INFINITE LOOPS!
